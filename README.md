Code Wars and Leet Code Exercises for Python proficiency

Beginning in November 2021, I started practicing weekly Python coding exercises on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com). Part of the joy from these exercises is seeing other folk's quick and witty solutions and also the most intuitive ones. It interests me to see how different minds create different comparable solutions for the same problem at hand. The more I learn about how others navigate a problem, the more expansive my python skills become.
